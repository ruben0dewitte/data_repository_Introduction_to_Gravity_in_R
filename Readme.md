# Overview

The code in this replication package performs analysis using one data
source (Vargas (2021)) using R. A Master file runs all of the code to
generate the data for the figures and tables in the paper. The
replicator should expect the code to run for about 30 secs.

# Data Availability and Provenance Statements

The data relied on in this paper can be found in the ‘./input’ folder of
the repository and is described in the Table below:

| Data File                      | Source        | Provided | Additional information                                                                                            |
|:-------------------------------|:--------------|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ./input/agtpa_applications.rda | (Vargas 2021) | yes      | Data on intra- and International trade data collected from the applications in the manual of Yotov et al. (2016). |

A codebook describing the variable labels for each included dataset is
available in ‘./input/codebook.xlsx.’

# Computing environment

This code was run on a x86_64-w64-mingw32 platform of a Windows 10 x64
(build 19044) computer.

The analysis is conducted in the R programming environment. R is free,
open-source and available for download
[here](https://www.r-project.org/). The code has been tested against R
version R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01).

Once R is successfully set up on your system, you will need to install a
number of external R libraries. I have used renv to snapshot the
project’s R environment. To install all of the necessary R libraries,
simply open R at the project root (e.g. by clicking on the .Rproj file)
and run the following commands:

``` r
## Run these commands in R

# install.packages("renv") ## Only necessary if the renv package is not yet installed on your computer
# renv::init()  ## Only necessary if you didn't open the repo as an RStudio project
renv::restore(confirm = FALSE)
```

# Instructions to replicators

All code files in this repository are referred to through the package
here(). This package finds the root as the place where the ‘.Rproj’ file
is located. For this repository, the .Rproj file is located in the root
folder, referred to as ‘./.’

The empirical data analysis takes place within the ./input, /code, and
./output directories respectively holding the external files, the code
that operates on the files in the ./input directory, and the
computational results. The structure of replication package is indicated
in the \`./code/00_MASTER.R’ file. Running this Master file will
reproduce all the results of this analysis and assign these results to
their respective output folders.

Further files and directories refer to:

-   The ./paper directory contains a sketch of the paper with numbered
    figures and tables.
-   The ./renv directory, along with the file ./renv.lock, captures the
    computational environment (see previous section)
-   The repository is dual-licensed (see ./LICENSE.txt). A Modified BSD
    License applies to all code, scripts, programs, and SOFTWARE while a
    Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License,
    applies to databases, images, tables, text, and any other objects.
-   The Readme files ./Readme.md, ./Readme.html, and ./Readme.docx are
    generated by ./Readme.Rmd. **NOTE: It’s fine if your write your
    Readme file in Word!**
-   The ./bibliography.bib and ./chicago-author-date-withnotes.csl files
    contain the bibliography in bibtex and the citation-style file.
